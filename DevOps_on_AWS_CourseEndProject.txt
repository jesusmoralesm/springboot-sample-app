Automating CI/CD Pipeline for Spring Boot 
Application Deployment on AWS

Objective
To implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services for automating the 
deployment of a Spring Boot application on Amazon ECS with Docker, 
integrating CodePipeline, CodeBuild and ECR for seamless updates

Problem Statement and Motivation
Real-time scenario:
Imagine a retail company that has a Spring Boot-based inventory 
management system. The system is used by several departments and is 
hosted in containers to ensure scalability. 
The company wants to reduce the manual intervention required to deploy 
updates by automating the build and deployment process. By setting up a 
CI/CD pipeline, developers can push updates to a GitHub repository, 
automatically triggering a sequence of actions that build, containerize, and 
deploy the application without downtime. This ensures faster and more 
reliable system updates, minimizing operational delays.

Industry Relevance
The following are the DevOps tools and AWS services used in this project:
1. AWS CodePipeline: A CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and 
deployment process of the application through a defined pipeline
2. AWS CodeBuild: A fully managed build service that compiles source code, 
runs tests, and produces software packages ready for deployment
3. AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry): A fully managed Docker container 
registry that stores, manages, and deploys Docker container images
4. AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service): A scalable container orchestration 
service that enables you to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster
Industry Relevance
The following are the DevOps tools and AWS services used in this project:
5. Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications 
inside lightweight, portable containers
6. IAM (Identity and Access Management): AWS service used to manage 
access to AWS resources, providing necessary permissions for CodeBuild 
and ECS
7. GitHub: A source code hosting platform that stores the Spring Boot 
application repository and integrates with the CI/CD pipeline.

Tasks
The following tasks outline the CI/CD pipeline creation process:
1. Fork the Spring Boot project GitHub repository and create an ECR to store 
the Docker images
2. Modify the build configuration file in the GitHub repository to include the 
ECR image URI
3. Create a CodeBuild project to pull code from the GitHub repository 
4. Create an ECS cluster using the Fargate launch type and configure an ECS 
service to run tasks on the cluster
5. Deploy the application
Tasks
The following tasks outline the CI/CD pipeline creation process:
6. Configure CodePipeline to trigger on GitHub changes, integrating 
CodeBuild and ECS for automated deployment
7. Test and monitor the pipeline execution in AWS CodePipeline
